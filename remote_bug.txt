		# Data Quality Calculation
		# The calculation for the Data Quality is as follows:
		# (Sum the total number of minutesâ€™ worth of data) / (Total number of days in the selected date range * 1440) * 100 to give a percentage. This calculation is the same for all reports.
		#
		# so for these 4 days of complete data, we have 4 days * (4 15 min intervals) * 24 hours of complete data.
		# to get the % they probably divide by max possible complete data, however
		# they incorrectly calculate days as: end_date - start_date, which is exclusive.
		# they should instead do somthing like: 1 + end_date - start_date.
		#
		# rows_data / (days
		# (4*4*24) / (3*4*24) = 1.333.. wrong.
		# fix:
		# 4/3 * 3/4 = 1.
		#
		# correct by:
		# (days-1)/days * result.
